# mobile-draggable-overlay
A draggable overlay that's able to go full screen or close just by dragging

The overlay has multiple snap points:
- full screen
  - When the height of the overlay is dragged to **75%** or **higher**. The overlay becomes **full screen** when let go off.
- 70% height
  - When the height of the overlay is dragged between **50%** till **75%**. The overlay snaps to **70%** height when let go off.
- 30%
  - When the height of the overlay is dragged between **25%** till **50%**. The overlay snaps to **30%** height when let go off.
- Close overlay
  - When the height of the overlay is dragged to **25%** or **lower**. The overlay **closes** when let go off.

The tutorial I used for creating this:
- [Tutorial page](https://www.codingnepalweb.com/draggable-bottom-sheet-modal-html-css-javascript/)
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac9Z6UtHdZ0)

## Reason for following the tutorial
I followed this tutorial so I can understand a draggable, resizable overlay for the mobile [DICE](https://dicelabel.com/) clothing item overlay.
